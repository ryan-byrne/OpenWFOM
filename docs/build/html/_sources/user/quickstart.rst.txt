Quickstart
==========

Once you've completed :ref:`install` and :ref:`arduino`, the system can start to
be configured.

The quickest way to do this is the ``wfom-configure`` (from the :ref:`command`).
Which can be run in `Verbose Mode` by opening a Command Line and entering:

.. code-block:: bash

  wfom-configure -v
