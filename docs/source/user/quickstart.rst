Quickstart
==========

Once you've completed :ref:`install` and :ref:`arduino`, the system can start to
be configured.

The quickest way to do this is ``wfom-quickstart`` (from the :ref:`command`).
Which can be run in `Verbose Mode` by opening a Command Line and entering:

.. code-block:: bash

  wfom-quickstart -v

This will check your system for the proper software and hardware.
